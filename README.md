# MovieLensRecommender

This repository contains an analysis and predictive modeling project using the MovieLens 10M dataset. The objective is to build a recommendation system to predict movie ratings based on user and movie features.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore the MovieLens 10M dataset, perform data preprocessing, and build predictive models to estimate movie ratings. The project includes data exploration, visualization, and various modeling techniques.

## Dataset

The MovieLens 10M dataset contains 10 million ratings and 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies.

## Models

The following models are implemented:

Baseline Model: Uses the mean rating as the prediction.
Median Model: Uses the median rating as the prediction.
Movie Effects Model: Incorporates movie-specific effects.
Movie and User Effects Model: Incorporates both movie and user-specific effects.
Regularized Movie and User Effects Model: Adds regularization to the movie and user effects model to prevent overfitting.
